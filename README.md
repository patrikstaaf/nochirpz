A simple website to create something apart from school projects, yet serve a bit of a purpose.

I wanted to play around with Next.js, especially its API routes, and also (kind of) mimic some data fetching to use getStaticProps. 
(First time trying out TypeScript, daunting but fun.)

Will probably/hopefully refactor the code as I go/learn.
